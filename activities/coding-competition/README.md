## Learning outcomes

* motivation, more intensive work during the lecture
* the teacher has an overview of how students work
* students can compare their own knowledge with the others
* physical activity 

## Setup and preparation

* The teacher share a (printed) [document](problems.pdf) with 8-12 easy programming tasks related with a lecture topic. Solving of each task should not take more than 5 minutes.
* huge table on a whiteboard, row for each student and column for each task.
 
## Activity overview

* Before the start - Teacher describes all competition rules. Students fill their own names (nicknames) into the table on the whiteboard. 
* During the competition - Each student solves all tasks individually. If he finish some, he can mark it into the table. Time of the competition is precisly measured, teacher regurally informs how many minutes left. 
* After the competition - the teacher according the table randomly pick some students to introduce their solution. Student is not examined by a teacher, he talks directly to the class and describe them how he solved the problem. Other students can ask or offer their ideas. One presentation takes at most 1 minute including questions. The winner is rewarded by candy or bonus points.

## Tips and tricks

* To motivate also weaker students, there should be at least two very simple tasks in the set. You should avouid to do it too difficult, otherwise anybody will participate on activity.
* In the table students can write an order in which they solved each task. It allows more precise evaluation of the competition.
* You can use table in a shared document to make the activity more calm.
* If someone do not want to present his solution, do not force him.
